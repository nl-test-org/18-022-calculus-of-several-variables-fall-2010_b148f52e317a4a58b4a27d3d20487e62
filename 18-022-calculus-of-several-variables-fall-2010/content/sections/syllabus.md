Lectures: 3x / week, 1 hour / session

Prerequisites
-------------

[18.01 Single Variable Calculus](/courses/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006)

Description
-----------

This is a variation on 18.02 Multivariable Calculus. It covers the same topics as in 18.02, but with more focus on mathematical concepts. Topics include:

*   Vector algebra, dot product, matrices, determinant.
*   Functions of several variables, continuity, differentiability, derivative.
*   Parametrized curves, arc length, curvature, torsion.
*   Vector fields, gradient, curl, divergence.
*   Multiple integrals, change of variables, line integrals, surface integrals.
*   Stokes' theorem in one, two, and three dimensions.

Assignments
-----------

Homework assignments are due on the second day of class every week. Late problem sets are not accepted, however the lowest problem set score will be dropped.
